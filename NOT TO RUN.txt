##DO NOT RUN IT UNLESS YOU WANT

1. Wipe Your Entire Drive
This command deletes everything from a given drive. If run against critical system partitions (like C:), youâ€™ll brick the machine.

powershell
Copy code
Remove-Item -Path C:\* -Recurse -Force
ðŸ’¥ Effect: Deletes all files and folders on your C: drive, even system files, leaving your OS unbootable.

2. Format Your Disk
This will wipe out all data on a disk.

powershell
Copy code
Get-Volume -DriveLetter C | Format-Volume -Force
ðŸ’¥ Effect: Erases everything on the drive and formats it, similar to running a factory reset but without an OS reinstall.

3. Delete System Files and Registry
This will remove the Windows folder containing core OS files.

powershell
Copy code
Remove-Item -Path C:\Windows\System32 -Recurse -Force
ðŸ’¥ Effect: Once this folder is deleted, your system will likely crash immediately and wonâ€™t boot again.

4. Shutdown in a Loop
This creates an infinite shutdown loop. Every time the machine boots, it will immediately shut down.

powershell
Copy code
while ($true) { Stop-Computer -Force }
ðŸ’¥ Effect: You wonâ€™t have time to interrupt or fix it before the next shutdown occurs.

5. Kill Critical Processes
Killing core processes like wininit.exe or csrss.exe will cause a blue screen of death (BSOD).

powershell
Copy code
Stop-Process -Name wininit -Force
ðŸ’¥ Effect: A BSOD will occur immediately, and the system will crash.

6. Disable All Network Adapters
This will block the system from accessing any network.

powershell
Copy code
Get-NetAdapter | Disable-NetAdapter -Confirm:$false
ðŸ’¥ Effect: All network interfaces will be disabled, making the machine completely offline.

7. Add Infinite Files to Fill Disk Space
This loop will keep creating files until your disk is full.

powershell
Copy code
while ($true) { New-Item -Path C:\Temp\file_$(Get-Random).txt }
ðŸ’¥ Effect: Exhausts all disk space, potentially crashing your OS due to a lack of space.

8. Disable User Account Control (UAC)
This compromises security by disabling UAC, making it easier for malware to run without user consent.

powershell
Copy code
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" -Name "EnableLUA" -Value 0
Restart-Computer
ðŸ’¥ Effect: Disables UAC, opening the door for malicious code execution.
